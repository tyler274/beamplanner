<h1>Starlink Beam Planner</h1>

<p>To provide internet to a user, a satellite forms a "beam" towards that user and the user forms a beam towards the satellite. After doing this the satellite and user can form a high-bandwidth wireless link.</p>

<p>Starlink satellites are designed to be very flexible. For this problem, each satellite is capable of forming up to 32 independent beams simultaneously. Therefore one Satellite can serve up to 32 users. Each beam is assigned one of 4 "colors" corresponding to the frequencies used to communicate with that user.</p>

<p>There are a few constraints on how those beams can be placed:</p>

<ul>
    <li>From the user's perspective, the beam serving them must be within 45 degrees of vertical. Assume a spherical Earth, such that all surface normals pass through the center of the Earth (0, 0, 0).</li>
    <li>On each Starlink satellite, no two beams of the same color may be pointed within 10 degrees of each other, or they will interfere with one another.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>Given a list of users and satellites, assign beams to users respecting the constraints above. Some test cases have more users than can be physically served. Do your best while remaining reasonably efficient.</p>

<p>Your solution will be run on a number of test cases. Each case includes a minimum number of users that <b>must</b> be served. Constraint violations, crashes, unhandled exceptions, serving less than the minimum number of users, or taking longer than the time limit will all result in failure.</p>

<table>
    <tr><th></th><th>Users</th><th>Satellites</th><th>Min Coverage</th></tr>
    <tr><th>Case 1</th><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>100%</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Case 2</th><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>80%</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Case 3</th><td>1000</td><td>64</td><td>95%</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Case 4</th><td>5000</td><td>700</td><td>80%</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Case 5</th><td>50000</td><td>36</td><td>1%</td></tr>
    <tr><th>Case 6</th><td>10000</td><td>720</td><td>80%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Solutions will be evaluated on user coverage, runtime, and coding style.</p>



<h3>Submitting</h3>

<p>Run <code>make</code> to run all tests and submit the results. Intermediate submissions will not be counted against you. Once you have passed all tests you may continue improving your solution for as long as you want.</p>

<p>Candidates who don't pass all tests within the time limit may still be considered on a case by case basis.</p>



<h3>C</h3>

<p>Implement your solution in <code>solution.c</code> and use <code>make</code> to compile and run all tests. You may use the C17 standard library and anything provided in <code>util.h</code> but no other third party libraries.</p>

<p>Only <code>solution.c</code> will be submitted, so please keep your solution entirely within it.</p>



<h3>C++</h3>

<p>Implement your solution in <code>solution.cc</code> and use <code>make</code> to compile and run all tests. You may use the C++17 standard library and anything provided in <code>util.h</code> but no other third party libraries.</p>

<p>Only <code>solution.cc</code> will be submitted, so please keep your solution entirely within it.</p>



<h3>Python</h3>

<p>Implement your solution in <code>solution.py</code> and use <code>make</code> to run all tests. You may use the Python standard library and anything provided in <code>util.py</code> but no other third party libraries.</p>

<p>Only <code>solution.py</code> will be submitted, so please keep your solution entirely within it.</p>



<h3>TypeScript</h3>

<p>Implement your solution in <code>solution.ts</code> and use <code>make</code> to run all tests. You may use the Node.js standard library and anything provided in <code>util.ts</code> but no other third party libraries.</p>

<p>Only <code>solution.ts</code> will be submitted, so please keep your solution entirely within it.</p>



<h3>C#</h3>

<p>Implement your solution in <code>Solution.cs</code> and use <code>make</code> to run all tests. You may use the .NET standard library and anything provided in <code>Util.cs</code> but no other third party libraries.</p>

<p>Only <code>Solution.cs</code> will be submitted, so please keep your solution entirely within it.</p>



<h3>A Note on Security</h3>

<p>This is not a security test - faking results or otherwise trying to subvert the grading will disqualify your submission. If you're interested in security we encourage you to apply to our software security roles <a href="https://www.spacex.com/careers/?department=Information%2520Security&search=">here</a>.</p>
